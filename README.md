# IT 325 AGARIO PROJECT
This project is an incomplete remake of the game agar.io.

## How the game is played
The player clicks and holds on the canvas with the mouse to lead the blob character around the map.
The objective of the game is to eat other players and blobs to become the biggest blob on the server.

## Things to know
